# smartMirror
Raspberry Pi 3: For this project, raspberry pi 3 is preferable. Other versions will also work, but make sure you have a Wi-Fi adapter if you use an older version.
Micro SD Card: Raspbian 
Monitor (with HDMI - in): This is the screen of the smart mirror. Any type of display with HDMI input can be used. If you want a bigger smart mirror, you can go with a 24- or a 32-inch monitor. In addition, for a mini smart mirror, we can use a 7- or 10-inch HDMI display.
HDMI Cable

USB mouse & Keyboard
Two-way mirror 

The idea is to enable a regular mirror with features of a smart digital device.
In this project, the mirror is capable of
- displaying current weather and prediction
- displaying current time
- maintaining a to-do list/reminder, which can be modified with voice instructions like "Hey, please add milk to my grocery list"
- News headlines

It also provides the user to add or remove widgets of their choice with minimal efforts.
