The idea is to enable a regular mirror with features of a smart digital device.
In this project, the mirror is capable of
- displaying current weather and prediction
- displaying current time
- maintaining a to-do list/reminder, which can be modified with voice instructions like "Hey, please add milk to my grocery list"
- News headlines

It also provides the user the option to add or remove widgets of their choice with minimal efforts.
